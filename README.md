# The Invisible People Project

A project close to my heart and I wish to use software to enable people to have well-balanced. The best way to enable someone to improve their life is to 1. arm them with knowledge on mental and physical health 2. give them a community with shared experiences. I hope to do both with this project, making this an open source project with feedback from the community of people with invisble illnesses

## mission
- To create a bespoke digital space for people with invisible illnesses and give them somewhere to share their experiences
- Provide science-based solutions: leveraging the body's physiology to elevate mental and physical wellbeing
- Increase visibility of these illnesses online
- Raising mental health awareness
